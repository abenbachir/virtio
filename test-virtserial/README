Test cases for testing the new virtio-console functionality that
exposes multiple ports to guests for generic communication.

Files:
------
test-virtserial.c: Standalone test program that can be run in the
  guest.
auto-virtserial.c: Runs automated tests. To be run on the host.

auto-virtserial-guest.c: Runs automated tests, to be run on the guest.

run-test.sh: Starts qemu and runs the automated tests

guest-kernel-config: A small config file that only enables a small
  subset of kernel features and a lot of debug options to test the
  virtio-console functionality thoroughly for memory leaks, locking
  correctness, etc.


Setup:
------
In my guest (f11-auto.qcow2), I've put the auto-virtserial-guest
program in /etc/init.d/ and put a line in /etc/rc.local to invoke it
upon boot:

<guest /etc/rc.local>:
/etc/init.d/auto-virtserial-guest &

When run-test.sh is invoked with such a guest, when the guest comes
up, the tests start running automatically.

Some settings in the run-test.sh script should be tweaked to match
your environment (especially the guest image file, qemu location,
etc.).

To be able to run the virtio console port test successfully without
selinux denying logins, you should do the following:

<guest /etc/securetty>:
Add a line saying 'hvc0'

<guest /etc/event.d>:
Copy tty1 to hvc0, replace all tty1 to hvc0 in the new file

To be able to test the udev symlinking rule,

<guest>
mount -t debugfs debugfs /sys/kernel/debug

<guest /etc/udev/rules.d>:
create a new file 90-virtio-ports.rules

and add the following text:

<guest /etc/udev/rules.d/90-virtio-ports.rules>
KERNEL=="vport*", SYMLINK+="virtio-ports/$attr{name}"

For the file checksumming test, place a (big) file in
/tmp/amit/big-file on the host

and

/tmp/amit/guest-big-file in the guest.


Also, other details are mentioned at:

https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Features/VirtioSerial

http://www.linux-kvm.org/page/VMchannel_Requirements

These programs are sensitive to some details, like the host program
(auto-virtserial) has to be started before the guest invokes
auto-virtserial-guest program.

More work is needed to make these programs fully ready; if you wish
you contribute, send me an email at <amit.shah@redhat.com>
